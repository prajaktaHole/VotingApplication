# VotingApplication

This To-Do application is a simple task management system built using Java and Hibernate ORM. It allows users to perform essential CRUD operations such as adding new tasks, viewing a list of tasks, updating task status, and deleting tasks. Each task includes fields like title, description, and due date, making it easy to organize and manage daily activities.

Hibernate is used as the core ORM framework to handle database interactions efficiently. By mapping Java objects to relational database tables, Hibernate simplifies SQL operations and minimizes boilerplate JDBC code. This project is ideal for beginners looking to learn how to integrate Hibernate into a real-world Java application and understand basic object-relational mapping principles.

The application can be further extended with a front-end using JSP, Servlets, or Spring MVC, and supports relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL. It demonstrates clean code structure, separation of concerns, and a practical use of annotations and Hibernate configuration files.
